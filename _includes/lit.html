                    <p class="text-muted">CreditUnionTimes applauds peer-to-peer lending platforms as a great opportunity to allow more access to credit. This idea was pioneered by European firm ZOPA and soon other companies like LendingClub, SoFi, and Funding Circle entered the space. These online marketplaces utilize big data and technology in order to function. Bank partnerships appear to be on the horizon as well as regulatory reform. Some of the top challenges will most likely be increased competition as more firms pour into the space, increasing cost of customer acquisition, and cybersecurity issues. Nonetheless, peer-to-peer lending is expected to remain a strong presence in the future of loans.</p><br>
